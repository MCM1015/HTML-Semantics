# HTML-Semantics
Refracting a code for a webpage by adding semantics to make it more accessible. 

# Overview
The purpose of this project was to take an exisitng html and css code for a website and refractor it - i.e. improve it.
An important aspect of being a good developer is taking a project and applying whatever acceptance criteria you are given. 
Another very important aspect is leaving code cleaner than when it is found. 
This project is a light introduction into these concepts. 
More specifically this projects requires editing/improving code so that the website is more accessbile for those with disabilities. By following proper html semantics and having a clean CSS file the website will run more efficiently, be more optimized for search engines and will work with various types of assistive technologies.
